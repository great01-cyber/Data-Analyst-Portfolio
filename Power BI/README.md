# SQL + Power BI Project: Pizza Sales Analysis  

In this SQL project, I use a wide range of SQL functions and clauses to analyze the Chinook database. These include:  

- **Filtering and conditions**: `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, `NOT`, `IS NULL`.  
- **Aggregations**: `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`.  
- **Grouping and summarizing**: `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`.  
- **Sorting**: `ORDER BY` (with `ASC` and `DESC`).  
- **Joins and set operations**: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`, `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`.  
- **String functions**: `UPPER()`, `LOWER()`, `TRIM()`, `SUBSTRING()`, `CONCAT()`, `LENGTH()`, `REPLACE()`.  
- **Date and time functions**: `NOW()`, `DATE()`, `YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, `DAY()`, `DATEDIFF()`, `DATEADD()`.  
- **Type conversion and formatting**: `CAST()`, `CONVERT()`, `ROUND()`, `CEIL()`, `FLOOR()`.  
- **Conditional logic**: `CASE WHEN ... THEN ... ELSE ... END`, `COALESCE()`, `NULLIF()`.  
- **Subqueries and expressions**: Scalar subqueries, correlated subqueries, Common Table Expressions (`WITH`).  
- **Window functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `NTILE()`, `LEAD()`, `LAG()`, `OVER(PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...)`.  
- **Data modification (if applicable)**: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `MERGE`.  
- **Views and indexing**: `CREATE VIEW`, `ALTER VIEW`, `INDEX` (if performance tuning is discussed).  

By combining these SQL techniques, I was able to generate insights into **customer behavior, sales performance, artist popularity, revenue trends, and playlist dynamics** within the Chinook database.

## ðŸ“Š Client Request: Power BI Dashboard  

The client requested a **Power BI interactive dashboard** to visualize business KPIs. I used the SQL queries above to prepare and transform the data, then built dashboards that included:  

- **Average Order Value (AOV)**  
- **Average pizzas per order**  
- **Total orders**  
- **Total pizzas sold**  
- **Total revenue**  
- **Daily trend for total orders**  
- **Monthly trend for total orders**  
- **% of sales by price category**  
- **% of sales by pizza type**  
- **Total sold by pizza category**

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Outcome  

- Delivered a **data-driven solution** combining **SQL + Power BI**.  
- Built **interactive dashboards** with drill-downs for daily and monthly sales trends.  
- Helped the client identify **top-performing categories**, **seasonal patterns**, and **revenue drivers**.  
- Demonstrated how SQL can serve as a **data backbone** for modern BI tools like Power BI.

âœ¨ This project highlights my ability to:  
- Write complex SQL queries using a variety of functions.  
- Perform **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** processes for BI.  
- Design **clean, insightful dashboards** in Power BI.  
- Translate raw data into **actionable business insights**.
