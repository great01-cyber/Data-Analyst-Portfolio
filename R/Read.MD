#Abstract
Climate change has emerged as the predominant challenge of the 21st century, as highlighted by the IPCC in 2014. Media representation plays a crucial role in shaping which aspects of climate change are emphasized and in motivating public engagement. Newspapers and television broadcasts, in particular, serve as pivotal channels of communication. Given the abstract nature of climate change, which many people experience indirectly, media coverage significantly influences public and political discourse, thereby impacting decisions related to both mitigation and adaptation strategies. Consequently, it is essential to examine how climate change is framed in the media.

Guided by framing theory and its various conceptualizations, this study analyzed the framing of climate change by two prominent media organizations: ABC and BBC News. Using a combination of content analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, the study identified four primary climate change frames employed by both media outlets:

Climate Change Action Frame – portraying climate change as a collective and shared responsibility.

Destruction of Nature Frame – emphasizing the urgency, awareness, and seriousness of environmental degradation.

Human Impact Frame – highlighting the consequences of climate change on humans and the environment, with recurring keywords such as “extreme heat,” “dangerous heat,” and “scary storm.”

Responsibility and Accountability Frame – focusing on human and industrial causation, particularly emphasizing high-emission countries.

The LDA topic model proved effective in detecting potential frames within the news corpus, while content analysis provided deeper insights into the use of keywords, headlines, and metaphors in framing climate change. Data were collected from LexisNexis, encompassing 1,000 news transcriptions, contributing to the relatively limited body of research on frame identification using LDA topic modeling.

The study also offers methodological contributions, providing recommendations for optimal use of LDA topic models in social science research. Overall, the findings expand understanding of global media communication and frame analysis, particularly given the limited prior research employing LDA for identifying media frames related to climate change.
